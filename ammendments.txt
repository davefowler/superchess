# Super Amendments to the rules of Chess

Amendment #1: Setup

Superchess uses the exact same peices as chess but instead of the traditional back rows setup the pieces are instead pulled to the corners.  Each player's queen is on a bottom corner on her color.  The king is in the other bottom corner on the opposite color. The rest of the pieces are pulled to the corners as well as shown.  Here is one side of a player's setup: 

                                           Rest of Board
    | Pawn  | Pawn  |       |       |       |       | Pawn  | Pawn  |
    | Rook  | Knight| Pawn  |       |       | Pawn  | Knight| Rook  |
    | King  | Bishop| Pawn  |       |       | Pawn  | Bishop| Queen |
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Amendment #2: Black moves first

Amendment #3: Pawns in the front cannot move 2 spaces on their first move,
             only side pawns may do this.

Amendment #4: Teleporting
    Conditions: Both of acting player's rooks must be eliminated. One
                of the teleporting pieces must be the king.
    Procedure: Any time during the game you can take the king and any
               piece within a three square radius of the king and put
               your rooks underneath them to make them teleporters.
               This takes one move. The pieces act as they always
               would except you can switch their places one time. This
               also takes a turn. You can only use this move once per game.

Amendment #5: (the ol') "Fork in the Eye" (trick)
    You may assassinate (murder) any of your own pieces, except the king. This takes one
    turn for each piece.

Amendment #6: Transforming Revival
    Bishops are the transforming pieces. At any point in the game, with the
    exception of course of an impending check, the player may choose to transform
    a living bishop into a previously terminated piece.

Amendment #7: Queen Suicide Bomber
    The Queen may destroy herself any time and take out all pieces in danger of
    her attack within a 2 square radius. Pieces of the queen's color are also
    eliminated in the explosion. This takes one move.

Amendment #8: Fusing Pieces
    If you can move legally into a square currently occupied by your own piece
    the two pieces may fuse creating a combination piece with attributes of
    both pieces. This cannot be done with the king. They are permanently
    fused after this move and cannot be separated. This takes one turn.

Amendment #9: Check Matin' (the sexy kind)
    The queen may move and share a square/(bed of hot lovin') with the king for
    one move where upon she must move away/(get out of his damned house) the very
    next move leaving a baby pawn behind, to be placed within a one square radius of
    the king.
